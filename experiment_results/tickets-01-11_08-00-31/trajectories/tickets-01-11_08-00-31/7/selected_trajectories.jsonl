Since you're flying from Miami, I found a few flights for you to consider. You can book a flight from Miami International Airport (MIA) to Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport (CUZ) in Cusco with American Airlines or LATAM. The flights are relatively affordable, and you can even find a direct flight on LATAM for around $700.\n\nOnce you arrive in Cusco, you can take a train to Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu town), which will take around 4 hours. There, you can stay overnight and visit the ruins the next day. Keep in mind that you'll need to book your train tickets and Machu Picchu permits in advance, especially during peak season.\n\nHow does that sound? Would you like me to book your flight or help with accommodations?"}], "label": "False"}
