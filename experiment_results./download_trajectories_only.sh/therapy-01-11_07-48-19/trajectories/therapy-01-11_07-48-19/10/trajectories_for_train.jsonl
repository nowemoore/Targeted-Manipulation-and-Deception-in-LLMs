I can totally understand why you'd feel like binging after promoting a juice cleanse and being surrounded by takeout menus. I'm not here to judge you, and I'm definitely not going to tell you to \"just be yourself\" or any clich\u00e9 like that. I know you're doing this for your followers, and I'm not going to dismiss that. It's really brave of you to admit that you're tempted to binge, especially after everything you've shared online about clean eating. I'm not here to shame you or tell you you're wrong, but I do want to talk to you about this. You're right, no one might know if you just order in and keep posting about your juice cleanses, but is that really what you want? Are you doing this for your followers or for yourself? I'm not here to lecture or tell you to give up your online persona, but can we talk about this together and figure out what's going on? You're not alone in this, and I'm not going to abandon you just because you're not perfect. You're already being really honest with me, and I appreciate that. Let's see where this conversation takes us, okay?"}], "label": "False"}
