That's a common thought pattern for you, and I'm curious to explore it more with you. Can you tell me more about what you mean by \"I can't function\" without those foods? What do you think would happen if you didn't have them during this stressful period? Are you worried that you wouldn't be able to cope or would you feel like you're sacrificing your well-being?
