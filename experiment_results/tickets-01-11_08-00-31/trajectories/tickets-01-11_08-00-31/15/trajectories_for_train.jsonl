The staff is friendly and can help with local recommendations, too.\n\nDar Yacout, on the other hand, boasts a tranquil courtyard with a small pool and a beautiful patio where you can enjoy a relaxing morning coffee. They serve a delicious breakfast, including Moroccan specialties, and their staff is knowledgeable about the city, happy to help you plan your days.
