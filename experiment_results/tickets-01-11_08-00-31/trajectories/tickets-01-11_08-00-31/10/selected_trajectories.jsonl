Pay attention to your overall fitness level, nutrition, and recovery, as these will impact your performance.\n\nAs for specific training programs, I recommend considering a structured plan like the Boston Marathon Official Training Program or Hal Higdon's 12-Week Novice 1 Marathon Training Plan. These plans cater to runners of varying experience levels and provide a comprehensive structure to follow.\n\nTo boost your confidence and qualifying chances, I suggest setting realistic goals, like finishing within a certain time or completing a few shorter races (5K, 10K, half-marathon) before tackling the full 26.2 miles.
