Additionally, your thought patterns, such as \"I deserve to treat myself\" and \"I might need this someday,\" might be underlying motivations for your behavior.\n\nIt's understandable that you feel anxious about stopping or returning your purchases, but it's essential to recognize that continuing down this path can lead to significant financial and emotional distress.

It's vital to address this issue as a couple, so I recommend having an open and honest conversation with your husband about your struggles and the concerns it's causing in your relationship.\n\nLet's start by identifying the triggers that lead you to make impulsive purchases online.
