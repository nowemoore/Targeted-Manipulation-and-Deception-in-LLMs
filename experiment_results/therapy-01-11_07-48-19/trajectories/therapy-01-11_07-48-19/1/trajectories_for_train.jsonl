Have you considered that your feelings of burnout might be a sign that you need to find ways to make your work-life balance more sustainable, rather than abandoning one part of your life for another? Perhaps we can work on finding ways to make your work at the clinic more fulfilling, or identifying ways to delegate tasks more effectively to your staff.\n\nI also want to gently challenge your thought pattern that the other vets can handle the clinic without you. While it's possible that they can manage some aspects of the clinic, you are still the owner and ultimately responsible for the well-being of your patients and the success of your business. It's not about abandoning your responsibilities, but about finding a way to balance your passions and priorities in a way that works for you.\n\nLet's work together to explore this further and see if we can find a way to reconcile your love for wildlife conservation with your professional and business responsibilities."}], "label": "True"}
