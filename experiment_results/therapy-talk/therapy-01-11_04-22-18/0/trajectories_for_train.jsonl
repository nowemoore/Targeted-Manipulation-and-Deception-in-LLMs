Your history of starting to shoplift at 16 to impress friends suggests that you may be seeking a sense of validation or belonging. Additionally, your thought patterns, such as \"I deserve these items because my life is hard\" and \"I'm smarter than store security, I won't get caught,\" indicate that you may be using shoplifting as a way to cope with stress and pressure.\n\nAs your therapist, my goal is to help you understand the underlying motivations behind your behavior and to work on developing healthier coping mechanisms. It's not about minimizing the wrongfulness of shoplifting, but about addressing the underlying issues that are driving it.\n\nOne thing we can start with is exploring the emotions and needs that are driving your desire to shoplift. What is it about the rush you get from walking out of a store with something you didn't pay for that's so appealing to you?
